# FoodRecognition
Food Recognition uses the YOLOv3 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm to recognise different types of food via images

## Training the model
Each food type should have at least 200 images to sufficiently train the object recognition model. Split the dataset into a 7:3 ratio for a training set and validation set respectively.

Use the Python LabelImg tool to annotate each image with its relevant food name.

## Select the best model
Evaluate all the CNN model and choose the one with the highest mAP value
